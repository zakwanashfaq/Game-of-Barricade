Zakwan:
everything should work as expected except the AI.
Could not get to that, as fixing bugs took a lot of time than I expected.
Also I did trace random bugs once in a while but was unable to replicate those when I later tried.
Which made it impossible to fix. If you face any bugs, just restart the game or keep on playing, 
it should not occur again.
But as of now while I did all my tests, there are no bugs at all. Everything works just fine.
